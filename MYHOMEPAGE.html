<H1>MY HOMEPAGE</H1>
<H2 CLASS="lead">FROM RECENT ACTIVITY USING BOOTSTRAP/CSS</H2>
   <section class="mb-5">
 <p class="lead">My name is Samielyn Parangat Ramos, and I am 22 years old. I am originally from Magsaysay Labrador, Pangasinan.I have two older brothers, one older sister, and one younger brother. Samuel Englis Ramos is my father's name, and Virgie Parangat Ramos is my mother's name. Because both of my parents are unemployed, I am self-motivated to complete my studies.</p>
 <p class="lead">Ramon Magsaysay Integrated School was where I studied from elementary through high school (RMIS). I graduated from Senior High School with a strand in Technical Vocational and Livelihood (Food Fish Processing), and I received my first National Certificate II in Fish Processing after a month of TVL training at JB Bagoong. Then I continue my journey to college evn my parents don't want me to enter college because of poverty.

 <p class="lead">I am presently a fourth-year student at Pangasinan State University's Lingayen Campus, where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science and Mathematics with a major in Computer Information Technology. I am taking this course because it is what my heart desires, and I am also passionate about it, even though it is difficult. I always put God first in my worries and difficult times. While studying, I am also a Volleyball Varsity member of PSU Lingayen Campus, where my team and I competed in a University meet in November of the 2018-2019 academic year. I'm a dedicated student with a high level of ambition. I enjoy a challenge and establish goals for myself on a regular basis so that I can focus my efforts. I'm not afraid to fail beacause failure is a part of college life, therefore I'm always seeking for new ways to succeed.
